# Ada Constraint_Error Example

This repository demonstrates a common error in Ada programming: the `Constraint_Error` exception. This exception occurs when a value is assigned to a variable that violates the defined range of its subtype.

The `bug.ada` file contains a simple program that illustrates this issue. The `bugSolution.ada` file shows how to handle this issue using exception handling and other best practices.
